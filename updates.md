## Log of all updates applied to the catalog:

**06-06-2017**
- Terzan 5: Distance/gal.coords/reddening/metallicity updated to values from Valenti et al. 2007
  - Note: More updates based on Valenti et al. 2007 will be implemented in the future.

**04-06-2017**
- Terzan 1: Coordinates updated to values from Picard & Johnston (1995).
  - Note: Terzan 1 coordinates seem to be inaccurate on [SIMBAD](http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=terzan+1&submit=SIMBAD+search) as well. This is particulary noticable in the Aladin image on the page.
  - Note: Values for half-light and core radii of Terzan 1 seem to be overestimated.
